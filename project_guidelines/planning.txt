Project requirements:


Introduction/Background:

-why are we interested?

-what do people need to understand prior to reading the project, prior information/research?

-where did the data come? how was it collected 

-question of interest?

VISIT: https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05409
<provides good information on why this data was collected, what makes it different>

<one division of task here for next time>




Methods/Results:

-How was data obtained?

-Summary and exploration of data:
***

-Appropiate analysises:
***

-Describe analysis, check assumptions"
***

-Relevant graphics

*** = bulk of our project, using topics from class as well



Conclusion:

-what was learned, conclusions for data

-how to improve design of study in future

-how could research be extended

What to take away from chapters:
2: Estimation:
-Demonstrate violation / lack of violation of ***Gauss-Markov*** assumptions, use standard mod and identify these assumptions 
(errors are uncorrelated, equal variance, and expectated value of 0, normality and IID not an assumption)
-Demonstrate how Least Squares works, match up result with result of lm(response~predictor) function

3: Inference: 
-Hypothesis tests
-Permutation tests (finding best set of predictors?)
-Conceptual discussion of confidence intervals


4: Prediction:
-dive into auto regressive models, since our accidents could be totally dependent on time of year


6: Diagnostics:
-Checking error assumptions, with constant variance, normality, correlated errors
-Outliers and influential points


8: Problems with Error:
-GLS, WLS need

<Discuss and choose where we have common knowledge in, what we think is most applicable with this project

11:
-recent material with shrinkage method and ridge regression

Couldnt find specific chapter/His lecture slides:
-ANOVA
-F Test
-Model Selection in general: Prev homework assignment

Takeaways:
-Division of tasks:
---Opening part of project, Introduction/Background
---Analysis piece: we can each take a concept and go in more depth on it, more so in class, apply it with our data, and explain
in greater conceptual detail/clarity than Dr. O and the book do. This sort of research could lead to connections to other concepts
and methods, and could drive the analysis piece of the project
